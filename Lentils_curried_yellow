Curried Yellow Lentils with Potatoes

Ingredients

1 cups dried yellow lentils
3 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoons madras curry powder
~1 cup plain Greek yogurt, mixed in 2 cups water
   (reserve a tablespoon of yogurt for each guest)
1 1/2 cups water
2 medium potatoes diced (small)

salt as needed
black pepper
fresh cilantro (optional)


Instructions
1. In a medium size pot combine, lentils, curry powder, and water/yogurt.
2. Bring pot to a boil, reduce to medium low (4) partially cover, and
    continue to cook while stirring occasionally for ~10 minutes, or until
    the lentils start to absorb water.
3. Add potatoes, cover completely and cook undisturbed for ~10 minutes,
    stir and add additional water if needed.
4. Cover and continue to cook on low (2.5) until the lentils and
    potatoes are tender, ~10 minutes. Add water if necessary, the mixture
    should be moist, but not soupy. Check and stir periodically to avoid
    sticking/burning the mixture on the bottom of the pot.
5. Add a pinch or two of salt and black pepper to taste.
6. Serve [optionally] garnished with yogurt and cilantro.
