Curried Yellow Lentils with Potatoes

Ingredients

1 cup dried yellow lentils
2 medium potatoes diced (small)
1 clove garlic diced
2 carrots, sliced/diced
1 small onion, diced
3 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoons madras curry powder
1 1/2 cups water or chicken broth

Finishing liquid
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, or
1/2 cup milk, or
1/2 cup cream

salt as needed
black pepper
fresh cilantro (optional)
~1 tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt for each guest (optional)

Instructions
1. In a medium size pot saut√© carrots, garlic and onion, until soft then
  combine, lentils, curry powder, and water/broth.
2. Bring pot to a boil, reduce to medium low (4) partially cover, and
    continue to cook while stirring occasionally for ~10 minutes, or until
    the lentils start to absorb water.
3. Add potatoes, cover completely and cook undisturbed for ~10 minutes,
    stir and add additional water if needed.
4. Cover and continue to cook on low (2.5) until the lentils and
    potatoes are tender, ~10 minutes. Add water if necessary, the mixture
    should be moist, but not soupy. Check and stir periodically to avoid
    sticking/burning the mixture on the bottom of the pot.
5. Remove from heat, add finishing liquid, and a pinch or two of salt and
    black pepper to taste.
6. Serve [optionally] garnished with yogurt and cilantro.

Cooking Note: If the cook is in a hurry, the potatoes can be added with the
              water/broth, bring the pot to a boil, then simmer for 20 minutes.
