1 small onion cut in quarters
1 clove garlic cut in quarters
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups water





1.  Combine the ingredients for the preparation of the lentils in a medium
    sauce pan, bring to vigorous boil then reduce stove setting to 2 1/2, and
    cover with lid.
2.  Simmer lentils for 25 minutes. Check for doneness, continue to cook
    until lentils are soft, but still firm, similar to al-dente pasta. Firm
    lentils are preferred, and should be done by 30 to 35 minutes.
3.  Reserve slightly less than 1/4 cup of the cooking water, drain lentils
    in a wire mesh strainer. Remove the bay leaves, all of the larger
    pieces of onion, and the garlic.
4.  Transfer lentils to a glass bowel, cover lentils, and cooking water;
    Allow both time to cool off before proceeding to the next step.
